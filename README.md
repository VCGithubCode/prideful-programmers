## Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD) Design

The Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD) for our venue directory provides a structured representation of the relationships and attributes of the City and Venue entities. This design helps in organizing the data and understanding how different entities are interconnected within the system.

![ERD](/documents/images/erd.jpg)

## ERD for Venue Directory

1. City
    - <strong>city_id (Primary Key):</strong> A unique identifier for each city.
    - <strong>city_name:</strong> The name of the city.
    - <strong>country:</strong> The country where the city is located.

2. Venue
    - <strong>venue_id (Primary Key):</strong> A unique identifier for each venue.
    - <strong>name:</strong> The name of the venue.
    - <strong>address:</strong> The address of the venue.
    - <strong>contact_info:</strong> The contact information for the venue.
    - <strong>opening_hours:</strong> The hours during which the venue
    - <strong>special_features:</strong> Any special features or amenities offered by the venue.
    - <strong>category:</strong> The type of venue (Cafe, Support Center, Club).

### Relationships
- A City can have multiple Venues. This indicates that many venues can be loacated in one city.
- Each Venue belongs to one City. This establishes that every venue is associated with a specific city.
