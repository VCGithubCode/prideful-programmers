## Technologies Used

### Languages

- <strong>HTML:</strong> Used for structuring the content on the web pages. It forms the backbone of the project, ensuring that all elements are correctly placed and accessible.

- <strong>CSS:</strong> Used for styling the HTML elements, providing the visual appearance and layout of the web pages. CSS ensures the platform is visually appealing and user-friendly.

- <strong>JavaScript: </strong>Adds interactivity and dynamic behavior to the web pages. It enhances the user experience by allowing for real-time updates, form validations, and interactive elements.

- <strong>Python:</strong> a primary programming language for the backend of the project. It is used in conjunction with the Django framework to handle server-side logic, data processing, and integration with the database.

### Frameworks

- <strong>Django:</strong> A high-level Python web framework that encourages rapid development and clean, pragmatic design. It provides robust features for building the backend, including user authentication, URL routing, and database management, ensuring a scalable and secure web application.

### Database

- <strong>PostgreSQL:</strong> A powerful, open-source relational database management system. Because of its reliability, scalability, and support for complex queries it is used to store and manage user data, safe space listings, reviews, and other critical information.

### Tools

- <strong>Lottiefiles Animations:</strong> Lottiefiles provides a library of high-quality animations that can be easily integrated into web applications. These animations enhance the visual appeal and user engagement on the platform.

- <strong>Google Embedded Maps:</strong> Google Maps API is used to embed interactive maps into the web pages. It allows users to visualize the locations of safe spaces, providing a geographical context and aiding in navigation.

### Supporting Libraries and Packages
